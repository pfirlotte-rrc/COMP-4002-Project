## Project Description

This project is a news aggregating site that allows for users to rate articles based on how relevant those specific articles are to the topic.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to create an account which allows me to rate articles, so I can inform others if the content is reliable.
- As a user, I want to browse a list of news articles grouped by topic so that I can easily find content.
- As a user, I want to see which articles are worth reading, based on the average ratings of other users.
